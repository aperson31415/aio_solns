# AIO Solutions
I might start updating this again, no guarantees.
From now on, I will be adding solutions in C++, so python solutions will only be available for some easier problems, and C++ for some harder problems (or easier if I'm bothered to resolve).

One big feature of this repo is the 'Hidden ORAC Problem Revealer' userscript, which just shows a bunch of hidden problem onto the problems page. See the folder and README.md for more information.
