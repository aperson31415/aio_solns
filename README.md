# ORAC Solutions
I might start updating this again, no guarantees (I have deleted all problems for now, because I'm going to add them in neater). By the way, if a problem file is just a number, it refers to [ttps://orac2.info/problem/id/](ttps://orac2.info/problem/id/)

One big feature of this repo is the 'Hidden ORAC Problem Revealer' userscript, which just shows a bunch of hidden problem onto the problems page. See the folder and README.md for more information.

Here is a list of the included problem's solutions:
